        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Web Development Projects:</strong> Beyond professional responsibilities, I am
                passionate about web development and often engage in personal
                projects to explore new technologies and design trends. This not only
                keeps my skills sharp but also demonstrates my commitment to
                continuous learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong> I actively contribute to open source projects
                within the web development community. Collaborating with other
                developers allows me to share knowledge, gain insights, and contribute
                to the growth of the development community.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Art and Design:</strong> I enjoy expressing my creativity through digital art
                and design. Whether it's creating website mockups or experimenting
                with graphic design tools, this hobby complements my technical skills
                and enhances my eye for aesthetics in web development.</li>
            <li><strong>Reading Technology Blogs:</strong> Staying abreast of the latest trends and
                innovations in technology is a personal interest. I regularly read blogs,
                articles, and participate in online forums to stay informed about
                emerging technologies, best practices, and industry updates.
                </li>
            <li><strong>Fitness and Well-being:</strong> Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is important to
                me. I engage in regular physical activities, such as running and weight
                training, to ensure a balance between a demanding professional life
                and personal well-being.
                </li>
            <li><strong>Language Learning:</strong> I am currently learning Deutsch and Albanian,
                reflecting my interest in expanding my linguistic skills. This pursuit not only
                enhances my cognitive abilities but also reinforces my commitment to
                continuous self-improvement.</li>
